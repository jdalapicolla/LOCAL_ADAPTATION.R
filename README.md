# Part 4 - Local Adaptation Analyses - Identification of Candidates Loci Under Selection

This suit of scripts were developed based on [LanGen_pipeline](https://github.com/rojaff/LanGen_pipeline)

## Scripts:
<b>1.</b> Filter datasets according to environmental/phenotype variables for GEA (Genome-Environment Association) and GPA (Genome-Phenotype Association) studies.

<b>2.</b> Predict values of a variable in the case Pilocarpine, using Machine Learning Algorithms.

<b>3.</b> Select variables for GEA and GPA analyses.

<b>4a.</b> Partial RDA for GEA analyses to identify candidate SNPs in a multivariate approach.

<b>4b.</b> Partial RDA for GPA analyses to identify candidate SNPs in a multivariate approach.

<b>5a.</b> LFMM2 for GEA analyses to identify candidate SNPs in a univariate approach.

<b>5b.</b> LFMM2 for GPA analyses to identify candidate SNPs in a univariate approach.

<b>6a.</b> Final RDA for GEA analyses comparing candidate SNPs from both approaches.

<b>6b.</b> Final RDA for GPA analyses comparing candidate SNPs from both approaches.

<b>7.</b> Venn Diagramm comparing candidate SNPs from both approaches in GEA and GPA.

<b>8.</b> Polygenic Scores for candidate SNPs in GPA studies.

<b>9a.</b> sPCA using candidate SNPs in GEA studies to map adaption in the study area.

<b>9a.</b> sPCA using candidate SNPs in GPA studies to map adaption in the study area.

<b>10.</b> Allele frequency heatmap using candidate SNPs for Pilocarpine in each population.
